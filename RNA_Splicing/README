Problem

After identifying the exons and introns of an RNA string, we only need to delete the introns and concatenate the exons to form a new string ready for translation.

Given: A DNA string s
(of length at most 1 kbp) and a collection of substrings of s

acting as introns. All strings are given in FASTA format.

Return: A protein string resulting from transcribing and translating the exons of s

. (Note: Only one solution will exist for the dataset provided.)
