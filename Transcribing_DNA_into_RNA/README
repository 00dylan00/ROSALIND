Problem
An RNA string is a string formed from the alphabet containing 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'U'.

Given a DNA string t
corresponding to a coding strand, its transcribed RNA string u is formed by replacing all occurrences of 'T' in t with 'U' in u

.

Given: A DNA string t

having length at most 1000 nt.

Return: The transcribed RNA string of t

.

GATGGAACTTGACTACGTAAATT

Sample Output

GAUGGAACUUGACUACGUAAAUU

###################### SOLUTION ######################
dna = "GATGGAACTTGACTACGTAAATT"
rna = dna.replace("T", "U")

### EOF ###
The problem is as simple as it seems: just read the string substituting T's for U's. The complexity of the algorithm is again O(N)

. You can transfer at the beginning.

Most programming languages have a function to replace a given character or substring by a new one. For example, in Python the function str.replace(old, new[, count]) can be used to solve this problem:
