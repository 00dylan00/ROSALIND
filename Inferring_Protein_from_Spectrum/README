The prefix spectrum of a weighted string is the collection of all its prefix weights.

Given: A list L
of n (n≤100

) positive real numbers.

Return: A protein string of length n−1
whose prefix spectrum is equal to L

(if multiple solutions exist, you may output any one of them). Consult the monoisotopic mass table.
